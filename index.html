            <p><em>Biologist, but became a <strong>Starbucks Barista</strong></em></p>
            <p>I'm currently working as a barista at <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> Golden Bull in Debrecen. I have a BSc degree in Biology, but after graduating, I became a full-time AmRest employee. I was quite good at biology and I had a possiby bright future ahead, but that carrier path didn't make me happy at all. At the end, the university just gave me anxiety and stress. I felt trapped while being there, and I felt lost while doing my thesis. I only felt alive when I started working as a student at Starbucks. This job gave me so much more than I could've ever imagined. I've changed a lot as a person and it's all for the better. I'm more open now, and I have more confidence in myself. I've always felt in the past that I'm good for nothing and I can't do anything right, but now, I know what I'm capable of and I'm proud of my hard work. I hope I can advance in my current job and I can become even more successful in the future. I'm happy to be a part of an amazing team, we make everything possible, and we Bring Fun to Life!</p>
